            <h2>So who is this guy anyways?</h2>
			<h3>Well, lets see...</h3> 
				<p>&emsp;<i>Favorites:</i><br>
				&emsp;<span class="favorites">Drink:</span> Coffee<br>
				&emsp;<span class="favorites">TV Show:</span>Toss up - Game of Thrones or Stranger Things<br>
				&emsp;<span class="favorites">Book:</span> The Martian<br>
				&emsp;<span class="favorites">Movie:</span> More than just one...but uh...Gladiator is in there.<br>

				</p>
				<p>&emsp;<i>The general:</i> Most people call me Jake. I grew up in California (Fresno/Clovis) and currently live in Arizona. I like video games, board/tabletop games (<a href="https://dnd.wizards.com/" target="_blank">D&D</a> is my favorite), spending time with my wife and our two sons (going to try and get them into D&D eventually!), watching Netflix, getting lost in YouTube and Imgur.
				</p>
				<p>&emsp;<i>Work:</i> Somehow (little bit of luck, little bit of my work ethic to get me recommended) I ended up going from a grocery store, to the largest aerospace company in the world. Being at that company has helped me pursue my <a href="journey.html">college journey</a>. I hope to continue my journey with my company after I graduate, and transition to a role that will utilize my skill set.
				</p>
				<p>I really don't like talking about myself that much, I'm going to end it here, perhaps I'll add some more later.</p>
