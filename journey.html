            <h2>My Journey</h2>
			<h3>The Late Beginning</h3>
			<p>&emsp; 
				The, albeit later in life, pursuit of an engineering degree for me, actually started with Electrical Engineering. Working as a calibration technician in a Metrology department (see <a href="metrology.html">Metrology?</a>), with my focus being mainly electrical calibrations, it seemed like the best fit <i> for where I was</i>. Once I started taking primary focus classes, it became quickly apparent that I did not enjoy the content offered, and would likely not enjoy the field either. 
			</p>
			<p>
				My pace had slowed, I was taking one class at a time, even at seven-and-a-half weeks per class, that is only two a semester, it was going to be quite some time till I would be done, even being just a bit half-way through the EE program. I had an assembly language programming course that needed to be done, around the time I enrolled for the course, I discovered ASU offered an on-line Software Engineering degree program. I did not know it then, but my path was going to change.
			</p>
            
            <h3>The Transition</h3>
			<p>&emsp; 
				The realization that there was enjoyment to be had, for myself, in the type of content being offered in the assembly language course was more than I expected. The sort of problem solving needed felt more natural. The fit for the content and challenges felt appropriate. I requested to transition to the Software Engineering program before the course was finished.
			</p>
			<p>
				The next step, take the first programming course required, and see if the appropriateness stuck. Why would I continue with this path if I did not enjoy it?
			</p>
			
			<h3>The Sojourn</h3>
			<p>&emsp; 
				First class in the program, Object-Oriented programming, since the degree path was Java focused, this was also my first Java class. I did really well, well enough that I was helping others in my class with issues they encountered. This experience opened my eyes a bit, I felt like I was doing something I could be good at, if felt like it could be, or was, the best fit <i>for where I wanted to be</i>.<br>
			</p>
			So far the course work has been great, and I'm flying through it faster than I ever was with EE. It is currently 2019 as of this writing, and the finish line is Spring 2020!
			<p>
			
			</p>
			<h3>The Next Phase</h3>
			<p>&emsp; 
				So the inevitable, what is next? This is still uncertain. I'm a thinker, sometimes to my detriment (or my wife's), and decisions like this require lots of time for me to process. There are lots of opportunities out there for my skill set I feel, and not just strictly what I have to offer from my degree, but soft skills as well. At least I have a better idea for <i>where I want to be</i> than when I started my journey.
				<p>I would love to stay with my current employer, since they have made my education journey possible. Who knows what is on the horizon, I know I don't, so I'll keep scouting.
