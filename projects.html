			<h4>Einstein Rosen Bus - Agile Team Based Project</h4>
			<p>
			The course, titled "Construction and Transistion" described as:</p> <blockquote><i>Best practices in software construction in the context of a team project, including refactoring, defensive
			programming, unit testing, and configuration and release management.</i></blockquote>
			<p>
			The team was given an existing code base, with its own issues to begin with. Our team was tasked with static analysis and fixing existing issues that would affect our project. Then we began the process of turning the task/calendar application into a bus scheduling application. Our team name was Berlin, so we used that as our base of operations! We used Java as the language, json files for persistent storage, gradle for building/running, GitHub for version control, Taiga for a scrum board, unit testing on everything we created, and performed official group based code reviews, as well as one on one peer code reviews.
			</p>

			<p>
			There really is a lot to talk about, most of it might be too boring (heh), so here is a video with a quick overview of the final deliverable:

			<h3>Database Management Class</h3>
			<p>
			As a team of three we were to come up with an idea for an application that would utilize a database (SQL). The idea behind this is a way for someone to search a data base for almost anything a store in their area might sell, they could see and sort by store location, item quantities, item prices, ect. It was a fun project, combining Java and SQL queries into a working application, we populated the data base with a couple thousand random dummy entries to prove it out. Below are a few screen caps of the interface, and a snip of query code.
